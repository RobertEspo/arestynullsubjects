Abstract

Heritage speakers (HS) are those who grow up speaking a language in the household that is different than that of the general society (Montrul xxxx). This study expands on previous research on children HS. A point of contention for bilingual grammars is at the pragmatic-syntax interface: in English, overt subjects are obligatory from the syntax (re: EPP); in Spanish, null subjects are preferred, while overt subjects are pragmatically required for discontinuous topics and emphasis.
